Our tests briefly goes through a few commands. First the configure file is written. Then the create function initializes the server and client's manifest. Then we add a file, chanigng the client's manifest. Then we commit it creating a local .commit file and one on the server. Then we push, removing the .commit on the server and creating a new file on the server (sent). We remove the project locally and then checkout the project. Then we call update creating a blank .update. We call upgrade and our client tells us up to date and destroys the update file. Lastly we create another project and then the server is shutdown.
